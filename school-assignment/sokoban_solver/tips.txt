For those who attemp this problem for the first time, below is my suggestions

1. carefully real assignment instruction and starter code, figure out the
	relationship between sokoban class and search class

2. when implement herustic function, start with manhattan distance first

3. improve the manhattan distance herustic by removing all the deadlock cases 

4. the hardest part is to find way to assign each robot to the closest box and
	assign each box to the closest storage


In my algorithm, numpy is used for generate distance matrix between box and
storage, scipy is used for assignment function. scipy helps to find total minimum
distance between boxes and storages. The assignment function used hungarian algorithm
to find each optimal pairs in the matrix, so that overall distance would be lowest.
